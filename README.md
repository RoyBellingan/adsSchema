# adsSchema
A mid n00bish approach to make sense in google ads api intricacy

Those are two DB one that tries to model the relationship between the various table, and one with the list of the fields that can be selected 

The protobug are almost useless in this case because is nowhere written which are the select only fields, plus they are snake_case, and the api camelCase
Also they are complex and big to manage. Is much easier to screpe a few pages!
